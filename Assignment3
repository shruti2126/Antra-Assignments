--1. Create a view named “view_product_order_[your_last_name]”, list all products and total ordered quantity for that product.
CREATE VIEW view_product_order_Sharma
AS
SELECT p.productID, p.ProductName, SUM(od.Quantity) as [total ordered quantity]
FROM Products p, [Order Details] od, Orders o
WHERE od.ProductID = p.ProductID AND o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY p.productID, p.ProductName

SELECT * FROM view_product_order_Sharma

--2. Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_quantity_[your_last_name]” that accepts
--product id as an input and total quantities of order as output parameter.

CREATE PROC sp_product_order_quantity_Sharma 
@productId int,
@totalQty int out
AS
BEGIN
SELECT @totalQty = SUM(od.Quantity)
FROM Products p, [Order Details] od, Orders o
WHERE p.ProductID = @productId AND p.ProductID = od.ProductID AND o.OrderID = od.OrderID
END

BEGIN
DECLARE @qty int
exec sp_product_order_quantity_Sharma 23, @qty out
print @qty
END
 --3. Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_city_[your_last_name]” that accepts 
 --product name as an input and top 5 cities that ordered most that product combined with the 
 --total quantity of that product ordered from that city as output.

 CREATE PROC sp_product_order_city_sharma
 @productName varchar(20)
 AS
 BEGIN
 SELECT TOP 5 p.ProductName, o.ShipCity, SUM(od.Quantity) as [total quantity ordered]
 FROM Products p, [Order Details] od, Orders o
 WHERE p.ProductName = @productName and od.ProductID = p.ProductID AND o.OrderID = od.OrderID
 GROUP BY ProductName, o.ShipCity
 ORDER BY SUM(od.Quantity) DESC
 END

 EXEC sp_product_order_city_sharma 'Queso Cabrales'

 --4. Create 2 new tables “people_your_last_name” “city_your_last_name”. 
 --City table has two records: {Id:1, City: Seattle}, {Id:2, City: Green Bay}.
 -- People has three records: {id:1, Name: Aaron Rodgers, City: 2},
 --{id:2, Name: Russell Wilson, City:1}, {Id: 3, Name: Jody Nelson, City:2}. 
 --Remove city of Seattle.
 --If there was anyone from Seattle, put them into a new city “Madison”. 
 --Create a view “Packers_your_name” lists all people from Green Bay. 
 --If any error occurred, no changes should be made to DB. (after test) Drop both tables and view.

 CREATE TABLE people_Sharma(id int, Name varchar(20), City int)
 INSERT INTO people_Sharma Values (1, 'Aaron Rodgers', 2)
 INSERT INTO people_Sharma Values (2, 'Russell Wilson', 1)
 INSERT INTO people_Sharma Values (3, 'Jody Nelson', 2)

 Create Table city_Sharma(id int, City varchar(30))
 INSERT INTO city_Sharma Values (1, 'Seattle')
 INSERT INTO city_Sharma Values (2, 'Green Bay')

 if exists(select id from people_Sharma where city = (select id from city_Sharma where city='Seattle')) 
 begin insert into city_Sharma values (3, 'Madison') 
 update people_Sharma SET city=3 where id in (select id from people_Sharma where city = (select id from city_Sharma where city='Seattle')) end 
 delete from people_Sharma where city = (select id from city_Sharma where city='Seattle')

 CREATE VIEW Packers_Sharma as
 Select name from people_Sharma 
 where id = (select id from city_Sharma where city = 'Green Bay')

 drop table people_Sharma
 drop table city_Sharma
 drop view Packers_Sharma

--5. Create a stored procedure “sp_birthday_employees_[you_last_name]” that creates a new table “birthday_employees_your_last_name” and fill it with all employees that have a birthday on Feb. 
--(Make a screen shot) drop the table. 
--Employee table should not be affected.

--6.How do you make sure two tables have the same data?
