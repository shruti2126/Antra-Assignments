--1. Create a view named “view_product_order_[your_last_name]”, list all products and total ordered quantity for that product.
CREATE VIEW view_product_order_Sharma
AS
SELECT p.productID, p.ProductName, SUM(od.Quantity) as [total ordered quantity]
FROM Products p, [Order Details] od, Orders o
WHERE od.ProductID = p.ProductID AND o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY p.productID, p.ProductName

SELECT * FROM view_product_order_Sharma

--2. Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_quantity_[your_last_name]” that accepts
--product id as an input and total quantities of order as output parameter.

CREATE PROC sp_product_order_quantity_Sharma 
@productId int,
@totalQty int out
AS
BEGIN
SELECT @totalQty = SUM(od.Quantity)
FROM Products p, [Order Details] od, Orders o
WHERE p.ProductID = @productId AND p.ProductID = od.ProductID AND o.OrderID = od.OrderID
END

BEGIN
DECLARE @qty int
exec sp_product_order_quantity_Sharma 23, @qty out
print @qty
END
 --3. Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_city_[your_last_name]” that accepts 
 --product name as an input and top 5 cities that ordered most that product combined with the 
 --total quantity of that product ordered from that city as output.

 CREATE PROC sp_product_order_city_sharma
 @productName varchar(20), @top5Cities varchar(250) out
 AS
 BEGIN
 SELECT TOP 5 p.productName, c.City, od.Quantity
 FROM Products p, [Order Details] od, Orders o, Customers c
 WHERE od.ProductID = p.ProductID AND o.OrderID = od.OrderID
 and c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
 ORDER BY od.Quantity DESC
 END


 --4. Create 2 new tables “people_your_last_name” “city_your_last_name”. City table has two records: {Id:1, City: Seattle}, {Id:2, City: Green Bay}. People has three records: {id:1, Name: Aaron Rodgers, City: 2}, {id:2, Name: Russell Wilson, City:1}, {Id: 3, Name: Jody Nelson, City:2}. Remove city of Seattle. If there was anyone from Seattle, put them into a new city “Madison”. Create a view “Packers_your_name” lists all people from Green Bay. If any error occurred, no changes should be made to DB. (after test) Drop both tables and view.

--5. Create a stored procedure “sp_birthday_employees_[you_last_name]” that creates a new table “birthday_employees_your_last_name” and fill it with all employees that have a birthday on Feb. (Make a screen shot) drop the table. Employee table should not be affected.

--6.How do you make sure two tables have the same data?
